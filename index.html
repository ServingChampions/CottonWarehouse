  <h2>Welcome to Cotton Warehouse Vendor Mall and Flea Market</h2>

  <p>
    The Cotton Warehouse Vendor Mall and Flea Market is a unique space with a rich history. Originally a cotton compress, the building has transformed over the years, and today, it houses a vibrant community of vendors and a flea market with over 100 booths.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our journey began when I, as a single mother, navigated yard sales and rummage sales to make ends meet. Eventually, this passion for selling led to the creation of successful yard sale groups on Facebook and an eBay venture. In 2016, we took on the opportunity to run the farmers market, and that laid the foundation for what is now The Cotton Warehouse Vendor Mall and Flea Market.
  </p>

  <p>
    With around 108 booths and a waiting list of 112, our market has become a bustling hub for vendors and visitors alike. The community has grown, and we've met wonderful people from all over. We continue to cherish every moment of this great adventure.
  </p>

    <p>
    Cotton Warehouse Vendor Mall and Flea Market is located at 552 Highway 6 West Batesville, MS 38606. While you are here to visit make sure to visit our neighbor nextdoor, "The Cotton Warehouse Classic Cars." Although we share one big building, Danny's end focuses on classic cars, our side is dedicated to the vendors' mall and flea market. The building is divided by a concrete wall, and we maintain the original press used in the early days, along with a significant bale of cotton.
